Here’s a README.md description you can use for your project:

# Cashfree Checkout Demo

This project demonstrates a simple checkout flow using **Node.js (Express)** with **Cashfree Payment Gateway**.  
It provides endpoints for order creation and serves a frontend checkout page.

---

## 🚀 Features
- `index.html` – Landing page
- `buy.html` – Checkout page
- `server.js` – Node.js backend server (Express) for handling API requests
- Integration with Cashfree APIs (sandbox mode by default)

---

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>

▶️ Running the Project

Start the server:

npm start


By default, the app will run on http://localhost:3000

🌐 Usage

Navigate to the Buy Now page (buy.html).

Proceed with the test checkout using Cashfree sandbox credentials.

Do you also want me to add **separate instructions for running order creation on port 3001 and status check on port 3002** (as per your recent setup), or should I keep it simple with a single `npm start`?
